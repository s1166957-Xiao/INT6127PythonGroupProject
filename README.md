Background:

With the rapid development of the e-commerce industry, the national express delivery volume exceeded 120 billion pieces in 2024, making "last-mile delivery" a critical link in the logistics chain. Due to issues such as irregular delivery times and scattered addresses within campuses, campus delivery stations have become the mainstream solution to address the last-mile delivery challenge. According to the "2024 China Express Terminal Service Development Report", over 60% of packages are delivered through these stations, with an average daily processing volume of 300-800 pieces, and even exceeding 1,000 pieces during peak hours at campus stations.


Plan / Solution：

In high-volume operational environments, express delivery stations increasingly require "efficient management tools" that address three core needs:

First, enabling staff to quickly complete parcel registration, inventory classification, and delivery verification; Second, providing users with clear pickup guidance; Third, efficiently integrating operational data (such as daily shipment volumes and statistics on delayed parcels). These requirements collectively form the practical application scenarios of the "Express Delivery Station Management System".

Most campus parcel stations still rely on manual registration and paper-based ledgers or "Excel spreadsheets" for management, creating operational pain points that severely impact efficiency and user experience.

Low efficiency: Manually entering parcel tracking numbers (13-18 digits) and recipient information takes an average of 30 seconds per parcel, often causing congestion during peak hours. Manual verification of names and phone numbers during pickup leads to user queues exceeding 5 minutes.

Inventory chaos: Packages are stacked by delivery time without proper categorization (e.g., "fresh produce", "bulk items", "delayed shipments"). This causes staff to spend time locating packages and increases the risk of misdelivery or loss (industry average loss rate is approximately 1.2%). Data is missing. Daily or weekly delivery volumes or delayed packages (i.e., packages that have not been picked up for more than 3 days) cannot be automatically calculated, making it difficult to optimize operational strategies (such as adjusting staffing during pickup peaks).

Poor user experience: Users cannot check the delivery status in real time and need to repeatedly consult the staff. If the information is wrong when picking up the package (such as entering the wrong phone number), disputes may occur.

The system will digitize the core processes of the station through Python programming, including "package registration, inventory management, pickup verification and data statistics", so as to directly solve the above efficiency and experience problems.
